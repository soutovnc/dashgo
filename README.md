This project is about a simple dashboard, with charts, responsivity, form, login, and more...

## 🚀 | Technologies

The technologies than I used for build it were:

- [React](https://reactjs.org)
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [ChakraUI](https://chakra-ui.com/)
- [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/)
- [Apexcharts](https://apexcharts.com/)

I also used yup, for validating the data on form, and form is builded with junction of yup and react-hook-form.
And I also took care to maintain responsiveness!!!

## 🔖 | Layout

Look this layout, I really like the use of this chart type!
